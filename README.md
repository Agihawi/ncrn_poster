# ncrn_poster

This repository contains the code used to produce a poster in R using the [posterdown](https://github.com/brentthorne/posterdown) package for NCRN in Sep 2020.

Here we report on the results of applying [SEPATH](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-019-1819-8) to cancer genomes of the 100,000 genomes project. Additionally we report on the taxonmic classification of assembled contigs accross the dataset.

The HTML version of the poster can be accessed [here](https://agihawi.github.io/ncrn_poster/)

The code used to produce the poster and plots can be found [here](index.rmd)
